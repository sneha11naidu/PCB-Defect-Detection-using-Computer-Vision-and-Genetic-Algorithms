# PCB-Defect-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-and-Genetic-Algorithms
At the heart of every electronic device, Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are the backbone.
Their production needs to be done with great care and attention to detail so that they
meet the high quality standards of electrical goods. Manufacturing defects, such as
missing holes or short circuits, compromise PCB functionality and are often caused by
mishandling or technical problems that could possibly happen during the production
phase.


This study investigates techniques for automating the visual inspection of Printed
Circuit Boards (PCBs) using Computer Vision (CV) methods. Various approaches were
studied, including both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLO architectures.
The focus was on prioritizing lightweight solutions suitable for deployment on
edge computers on factory floors.
The cutting-edge YOLOv9 model was chosen for custom training due to its recent
introduction and outstanding performance benchmarks. To further enhance data quality
and improve model accuracy, the RoboFlow tool was utilized for sophisticated image
pre-processing and augmentation techniques. Additionally, a Genetic Algorithm was
implemented to optimize the modelâ€™s performance, refining its ability to detect even
subtle defects in PCBs.


This research explores how genetic algorithms (GA) can we employed to improve
model performance while minimizing detection time. This ensures that the model not
only performs efficiently in terms of speed but also maintains robustness. The customtrained
YOLOv9 model with implementation of GA takes an average detection time of
1-2 seconds, demonstrating its suitability for real-time factory floor inspection, where
rapid defect detection is critical.
